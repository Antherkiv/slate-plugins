> This module is for testing pourposes only in hope to grow and become a real set of slate-plugins
> But you have interesting examples (not completed yet :neckbeard:, the following are completed):
>
> 1. Use lerna to manage and bootstrap monorepo.
> 2. Intensive use of npx to take the command for npm root (as you can see and the only plugin writing yet I mean the prepare script command)
> 3. Compile typescript and typescript xml with rollup.
> 4. Use parcel for fast development (if it's useful please use it).

```console

john@doe master:xxxx
(22:26:50) ~/d/j/slate-plugins ❯❯❯ npx lerna bootstrap --hoist

john@doe master:xxxx

> Thanks for reading, I hope you can learn along with me.
